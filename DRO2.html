        %li.yel The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) offers three programs of study leading to the bachelorâ€™s degree. They are the Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering, the Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and a double degree of Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.

        %li.ri For admission to the aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering programs, students must meet the requirements for admission to the College of Engineering. A minimum grade point average of 2.25 in all science, mathematics and engineering courses and a minimum 3-GPA calculation of 2.25 in any UTA coursework is required for unconditional transfer into the department.
        %li.ri The degree map for Aerospace Engineering can be found here. It helps incoming students identify classes that they will need to take in the future. It can also help give an estimate to how many classes, as well as, approximate how much time it will take to finish the degree plan.<button type="button">Degree Plan!</button>
